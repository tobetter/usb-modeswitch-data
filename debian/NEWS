usb-modeswitch-data (20110227-1) unstable; urgency=low

  usb-modeswitch from its 1.1.7 version searches for its hardware switching
  database in a tarball (/usr/share/usb_modeswitch/configPack.tar.gz) first.
  Hence usb-modeswitch-data now only ships this tarball instead of the raw
  database files under /etc/usb_modeswitch.d .

  If you had modified some of these database files, they have been kept in
  place and will override the entries from the tarball, see the README.Debian.

usb-modeswitch-data (20100110-1) unstable; urgency=low

   usb-modeswitch-data 20100110-1, which includes the data for usb-modeswitch
   >= 1.0.7-1 now again makes the rules "opt-out".

  * It seems that the modem-modeswitch was somehow a kernel experiment and
    that usb-modeswitch which was originally aimed to death gained a new life.
    See http://bugs.debian.org/557610#19. Sorry for the ping-pong.
