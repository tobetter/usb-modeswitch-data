usb-modeswitch-data (20100110-1) unstable; urgency=low

   usb-modeswitch-data 20100110-1, which includes the data for usb-modeswitch
   >= 1.0.7-1 now again makes the rules "opt-out".

  * It seems that the modem-modeswitch was somehow a kernel experiment and
    that usb-modeswitch which was originally aimed to death gained a new life.
    See http://bugs.debian.org/557610#19. Sorry for the ping-pong.
